Introduction:

The Welsh Results Reporting Service (WRRS) allows health care professionals (HCPs) across Wales to access, enter and view laboratory results for pathology requests and any other associated results across all health boards in Wales, from both primary and secondary care. WRRS originates from the Welsh Laboratory Information Management System (WLIMS), which covers all of Wales. 


Using the WRRS data:

WRRS currently contains pathology results from WLIMS, but has the potential to expand to other areas of WLIMS. A definition dictionary for areas of interest is being derived in SAIL. To date, the following areas have been investigated:

•	Biochemistry

•	Cancer

•	Cardiovascular 

•	Full Blood Count (FBC)

•	Immunity

•	Musculoskeletal

•	Renal

•	Respiratory Tract Infection (RTI) 

•	Thrombosis

•	Urinary Tract Infection
